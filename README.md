# Init-Mac-Developer
Things you need as a developer on your new Mac. 

Let's start with the basics:

1. Install [iTerm](https://www.iterm2.com/). It's much more powerful than your plain old macOS terminal.
2. Let's make our terminal even better. Install Nick Plekhanovâ€™s Dotfiles from [https://github.com/nicksp/dotfiles](https://github.com/nicksp/dotfiles). You'll also be switching to **zsh** from bash.
3. You'll also need a good package manager. Let's begin with **Homebrew**. Simply paste the following in your terminal.

```
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```
